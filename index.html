        <h1>Hi! I'm Divay Prakash.</h1>
        <p>
            I'm an undergrad student at IIIT-Delhi, pursuing BTech in Computer Science and Engineeering. In a nutshell, I am a simple soul, who likes being with friends, spending time with family, and treating life like it’s a new day, everyday. I have very eclectic tastes, with the music I listen to ranging from metal to jazz, and books from sci-fi to classical literature. I play the guitar and am learning to play the drums. I’m not an avid gamer, but I enjoy strategy and racing games, though I am always up for Counter-Strike! I’m a voracious reader, soaking in anything I can lay my hands on. I enjoy programming and web design, so more often than not I’ll be holed up with my laptop and some coffee (well, lots of it actually!). I am fascinated by the world around me, and being a keen programmer, I love to hack and create amazing things that make a difference.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am an enthusiastic person who enjoys overcoming challenge and achieving personal goals. My present career aim is to work within IT . The opportunity to learn new skills and work with new technologies is particularly attractive to me. I have a clear, logical mind with a practical approach to problem solving and a drive to see things through to completion. Working with a team to analyze and solve problems gives me immense joy. I am creative and artistic and have a great eye for detail, being a true perfectionist at heart. I am eager to learn and I enjoy overcoming challenges. I have strong technical skills as well as excellent interpersonal skills. You will find me to be extremely hardworking, and able to juggle multiple tasks with great time management, or focus all my energy on just one too.

            Apart from English and Hindi, I also speak geek.
